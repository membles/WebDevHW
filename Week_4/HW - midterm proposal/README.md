#Midterm Proposal

I plan to make a website to act as a portfolio for both my school and personal projects. I will sort the projects using the following categories:

+ Web Dev
+ 3D Models
+ Digital Art
+ Games

Each category will get its own page. Each page will display projects as a grid of thumbnails with titles. Clicking on a thumbnail will open a new page with more information about that project and more photos.
